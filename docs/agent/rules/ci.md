# CI and the justfile

<!-- agent-standards v0.7 — synced from agent-standards. Edit it there, not here. -->

Read before changing a workflow under `.github/workflows/` or the `justfile`.
Both changes need the owner's approval first (shared rules, "Ask the owner
first").

## Same commands locally and in CI

- The `justfile` is the one place that says how to lint, format, type-check,
  test and build. CI calls its recipes; it never repeats their commands.
  What passes on your machine is what CI runs.
- Every repository has the recipes `check`, `fix`, `test` and `build`. A
  recipe that does not apply to a project prints that and exits 0 (for
  example, a library with nothing to build). A recipe that applies but
  cannot run here exits non-zero with the reason.
- Formatters run in check mode in `just check`. Do not commit unformatted
  code.
- Unity is the one exception to "CI calls the recipe": the editor exists in
  CI only as a Docker image, so the `test` job runs the same Edit Mode tests
  through GameCI instead of `just test`.
- If the repository has an architecture check (import-linter,
  dependency-cruiser, assembly references), `just check` runs it. It is
  optional, so new repositories are not blocked by it.

## Same job names everywhere

Every repository's CI has these jobs, with these names, so every ruleset
requires the same checks:

| Job | Runs |
|---|---|
| `check` | Toolchain setup, then `just check` |
| `test` | Toolchain setup, then `just test` |
| `build` | Toolchain setup, then `just build` |

The shared checks from agent-standards run in a `standards` job that uses
the agent-standards action, pinned by SHA, after a checkout with
`fetch-depth: 0`. It checks `project.yml`, the PR title, file and function
size, literal comparisons, duplicate constant values, suppressions, pinned
actions, release tags and secrets (gitleaks). Findings appear on the lines
of the PR diff, each with the fix and the rule. It starts in `mode: warn`;
the owner switches a repository to `mode: fail` once its warnings are
understood. Secrets fail in either mode. Jobs that
only make sense for one project (a Windows build, a Docker image) are extra
jobs, listed in `docs/agent/verification-matrix.md`.

## Workflow hygiene

- `permissions: contents: read` at the top. Grant more only to the job that
  needs it, with a comment saying why.
- Every job has `timeout-minutes`.
- Pull request runs cancel older runs of the same PR (`concurrency` with
  `cancel-in-progress` on pull requests only).
- Actions are pinned to a commit SHA (`dependencies.md`, GitHub Actions).
- Secrets are read only in the step that needs them, through `env:`.
- Triggers: pull requests and pushes to the default branch. Use
  `workflow_dispatch` only for manual runs; no `schedule:` unless the issue
  asks for one.

## CI is the source of truth

- Every check you are told to run locally also runs in CI.
- A check that could not run must not look like a pass. A skipped test job
  fails or shows a visible warning, and a required check proves the tests
  ran.
