# Code rules

Read before writing or changing code.

## Size and complexity

Large files and functions were the most repeated problem across these
repositories, and they grow one PR at a time. Keep new code within the limits
in `thresholds.md` (same folder). They are the defaults of each language's standard
linter. In short:

| Language | File | Function |
|---|---|---|
| Python | 1000 lines | 50 statements, cyclomatic complexity 10 |
| TypeScript / JavaScript | 300 lines | 50 lines, cyclomatic complexity 20 |
| C# | 1000 lines of code | 80 lines of code, cognitive complexity 15 |

- CI uses a ratchet: existing files over a limit may not grow, and new files
  must fit. You never have to fix old debt to land a change, but you may not
  add to it.
- If a change would push a file or function over its limit, split it first,
  in the same PR or a preceding one. Appending to the biggest file is not
  the default.
- A real exception (generated code, a data table, a Unity scene builder) goes
  in `size-exceptions.txt` with a one-line reason, so it gets reviewed.

## Names over literals

A value with meaning to the program is defined once, by name, and used by
that name everywhere. How many times it appears today does not matter.

- **What counts:** any value that is compared against, switched on, routed
  on, persisted, logged as a key, or sent across a boundary: URL paths, query
  keys and their values, status and state names, tab or mode keys, event
  names, HTTP status codes, file names, environment variable names, schema
  versions, error codes.
- **Such a value is never a bare literal**, even if it appears only once.
  `if status == "ok"` is not allowed; `if status is Status.OK` is. The single
  place a literal may appear is the line that defines the constant or enum
  member.
- **One value, one name.** Two constants with the same value are only
  allowed when they are genuinely different concepts that happen to coincide
  (and then say so in a comment). Renaming, splitting or re-declaring a value
  to dodge a duplicate check is the same violation.
- **Related values live together** in one enum or constants module per
  domain, not scattered as module-level strings.
- Use the language's own facility: `StrEnum` or `HTTPStatus` in Python,
  `as const` objects or union types in TypeScript, `enum` or `const` in C#.
- **Not covered:** user-facing copy (it belongs to the i18n or copy layer of
  the project), log message text, test data, docstrings, and language idioms
  (`__name__ == "__main__"`, `0`, `1`, the empty string).
- CI enforces this two ways, both with the ratchet (existing cases are
  listed, new ones fail):
  - Linters flag comparisons against literals: ruff `PLR2004` with
    `allow-magic-value-types = []` in Python (its default ignores strings),
    and an ESLint `no-restricted-syntax` rule in TypeScript.
  - The shared literal check, for every language including C#, flags the same
    string literal in two places, a comparison or `switch` case on a string
    literal, and two constants defined with the same value.

## Types

- New code is fully typed. No new `Any` without a comment that says why, no
  new `@ts-nocheck` or `@ts-ignore`, no new `#pragma warning disable`.
- Data that crosses a layer (database row to template, API response to
  domain) gets a typed model rather than a raw dict or row.
- The number of existing suppressions may only go down (CI counts them).

## Errors

- Never swallow an error silently. Every `except`, `catch` or `.catch()`
  either handles the error, logs it with context, or re-raises. If swallowing
  is intended (best-effort cleanup), say so in a comment.
- Catch the narrowest exception type that fits. A broad catch needs a
  comment.
- Log enough to diagnose (operation, ids, file path), and never secrets,
  tokens, private keys or personal data.

## One source of truth

- Do not copy logic between modules. Shared mapping, validation or scoring
  lives in one place that both callers use.
- A contract defined in more than one language (schemas, enums, API types)
  is either generated from one source or covered by a parity test that runs
  in CI whenever any of the copies changes.

## Tests

- Every behaviour change comes with tests. Every bug fix comes with a test
  that fails without the fix.
- Tests use no network and no real credentials. Fixtures hold no secrets and
  no real personal identifiers.
- A refactor that claims "no behaviour change" says how that was verified
  (same tests, same routes, same messages, and so on).
